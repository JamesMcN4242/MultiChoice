PROJECT TEMPORARILY POSTPONED. 
This has been postponed until the Christmas holidays (19th of December) when more time is available to work on it. Work on this has been halted due to a large number of daily commitments accumulating, mostly focused around my own personal daily studies.

# MultiChoice
A multiple choice system that will randomly select one option. Can be viewed, started and altered by multiple users at once.

Although this type of app can probably be found a million places online already, my friends managed to sell me on making it. 
Since there would be networking I'd need to create for this particular brand of it, I got interested in a 'join code' like implementation that I'll be using this project to try out.
