# MultiChoice
A multiple choice system that will randomly select one option. Can be viewed and altered by multiple users at once over a LAN connection. Only the host can start the selection mechanic.

Although this type of app can probably be found a million places online already, my friends managed to sell me on making it. 
Since there would be networking I'd need to create for this particular brand of it, I got interested in a dummy 'join code' like implementation that I tried out in this project.
Essentially it's the host's IP but disconfigured into a Hexadecimal-like value that seems nicer to input, such as: T2 Q8 A0 F3

Currently works only on a local network - really unappealing to the eye. But a relaxing side project to tinker with every so often. 
Although I'm stopping the implmentation of this for now, I think it has served as a nice and easy re-introduction to network programming, which I may try go deeper with for a LAN type game soon.
May come back to this repo later to try make it work over WAN, or just look/feel nicer. But for now I'm satisified I got what I wanted out of this project.
