# MultiChoice
A multiple choice system that will randomly select one option. Can be viewed, started and altered by multiple users at once.

Although this type of app can probably be found a million places online already, my friends managed to sell me on making it. 
Since there would be networking I'd need to create for this particular brand of it, I got interested in a 'join code' like implementation that I'll be using this project to try out.
